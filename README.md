# My first Python App

Simple Python scripts done in my first approach to this language

## Scripts folder

Some Python scripts to lear how this language works:

- [How to print something on the terminal](./scripts/hello.py)
- [How to create variables](./scripts/variables.py)
- [How to create and use functions](./scripts/functions.py)
- [How to perform flow control](./scripts/flow-control.py)
- [How to create list, iterate it and add new
  values](./scripts/loops-and-lists.py)
- [How to install, import and use Pandas library](./scripts/basic-pandas.py)

## Star Wars Extract, Transform and Load (ETL)

An example opf how works ETL. In this exercise I extract data about some
characters of Star Wars. Then, I create a new column and a new table with the
data filtered. At the end, I load each table in a file to save the changes.

Take a look at the [statement](./star-wars-character-etl/statement.md) and the
[source code](./star-wars-character-etl/etl_star_wars.py).
